# Tic-Tac-Toe
I have made Tic-Tac-Toe Puzzle/ Mini Project in Python.

Hello Guys I have implemented Tic-Tac-Toe in python.

So in the beginning when I began to master programming language, it was a fun way to learn the programming language and it is always been by developing the projects such as game which i would use in my daily life.

What we will do?

We will construct a two-player tic-tac-toe game, which we can play in the order line. At first, we'll make a vacant game board and afterward we'll take contributions from the players and we'll check for the triumphant condition and if the entire board gets filled and nobody wins, we'll announce the outcome as "Tie" and inquire as to whether they need to restart the game.

What we will utilize?
  We will construct this game using Python 3.

What we will grasp?
  After constructing this game, we will get a clear idea of dictionaries in python, how to access dictionaries in python.

How does the game function?
  So firstly we will use numbers from 1 to 9 to represent the board. And more, subsequently, a player can take their action in the game board by entering the number from the number pad.

In Code, firstly we have made a game board by using dictionary. As dictionary is a primitive data which stores data in 'key:value' format. We have created a dictionary of length 9 and each key will represent a block in the board. And have create a function Board() which we can use each and every time we want to print the updated board in the game.

Now, in main function, we will first take the input from the player and check if the inputs are valid or not.

Now we will check the winning condition, there are total of 8 conditions and whichever player has made the last move, and last we will declare the player has won. And if no one wins we will declare as tie.

At the last we will ask the player if they want to play again or not.
